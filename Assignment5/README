Running Instructions:
python mdpvi.py [worldfile] [epsilon value]
Example:
python mdpvi.py World1MDP.txt 0.5

Answer to question:
If we decerease the value of epsilon, the solution path does not change. This is because this further refines the search, but with an epsilon of 0.5,
we have already found the optimal path. Refining the utilities only refines the expected utility. However, if we increase epsilon to greater than 
about 3, our expected values become much less refined, and lose accuracy. At this point, the path changes to a less optimal solution (which we can tell
by the fact that it heads towards a mountain instead of a plain). As mentioned, if we increase epsilon, we are telling the value iteration to stop with
less calculations performed, meaning we get less accurate estimates. With an iterative calculation method, it is always better to have more calculations
(within reason of course).
